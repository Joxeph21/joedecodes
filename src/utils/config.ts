  DESCRIPTION: ` Hi, I'm Joseph Adenugba (Joe), i'm a frontend developer with over 4
            years of experience in building user-friendly web applications. I am
            passionate about what i do and always eager to learn new
            technologies and improve my skills. I specialize in not just
            building but in creating meaningful user experiences. I approach
            every project as if it’s my own, aiming for that “wow” factor that
            makes people say, “You built this?” I value collaboration, team work
            and communication, as it is a key factor in production. Let's work
            together to bring your ideas to life! 😉`,
