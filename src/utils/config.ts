      "LuminPlay is an educational platform designed to support children struggling with attention, memory and comprehension. The project was developed to address the gap between a child's unique cognitive profile and their learning needs. The platform is structured around three core pillars: Play, Learn, and Grow. It offers a variety of interactive games and activities that make learning fun and engaging, while also providing tools for parents and educators to track progress and customize learning experiences. The system automatically measures key performance indicators such as attention span, memory retention, and comprehension levels, allowing for a tailored educational journey that adapts to each child's strengths and challenges.",
